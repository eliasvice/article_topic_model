5989eb520d76d21adfa69715;en_us;2018-02-22;I Drank for Five Straight Days to See Which Hangover Cures Work Dispatches from the world's most insane cocktail festival. I'm panic-chugging water in my New Orleans hotel room. The stories I've heard from veteran Tales of the Cocktail attendees has inspired my fear-based hydration effort. Tales of the Cocktail is billed as the world's premier cocktail festival, a 5-day extravaganza of alcohol-related educational seminars, tastings, and parties marketed as an opportunity for professional growth. However, the festival has become either infamous or legendary, depending on who you ask, for the hardcore drinking that goes down in the swampy Louisiana summer heat.Another night at Tales of the Cocktail. Photo courtesy of Jennifer Mitchell Photography. I'm here attending Tales for four days to find out if some of the world's best booze professionals are holding secrets to the world's best hangover cures. If they are, they'll be putting them to use this week in New Orleans.  Day One  It's a brutally hot and muggy 87 degrees with 75% humidity outside. Who picked mid-summer to throw this thing in the summer? Satan? I scroll through social media and see a few Tales-related posts about Pedialyte purchases.  'Pedialyte® is not a hangover cure, but it can help with the dehydration you may experience after a couple of cocktails,' the oral electrolyte solution's website reads. 'If you're feeling tired, have a headache, or are experiencing other signs of dehydration after a couple drinks, see the Lyte and rehydrate with Pedialyte to feel better fast.'  Booze people like Marshall Seyler swear by Pedialyte for their hangover needs. Seyler, a bartender at Civil Liberties in Toronto, immediately hits a drug store when he gets to Tales. On his shopping list? 'One case of water, a shopping cart full of Pedialyte, two cases of Miller High Life, and a carton of cigarettes,' he tells me.  Seyler pairs Pedialyte with his alcohol. He makes strawberry kiwi Pedialyte ice cubes to throw into Pinot Grigio. 'Strawberry kiwi and pinot grigio is fucking delicious,' he says. 'Your hangover is gone. Second option: flavorless Pedialyte put in a Bloody Mary as the salt element so you hydrate with electrolytes while you get drunk.'  San Francisco-based spirits journalist and 12-time Tales attendee Camper English also stocks up on electrolytes for Tales. 'I take Nuun, which is an electrolyte fizzy tablet. It's great,' he says. 'I do that if I'm generally feeling a little sluggish in the morning. It's basically a Gatorade pill.'  When night falls, a friend of mine and I head out to Bourbon Street to take in the sights and get our hands on a po' boy. We do just that, then begin a journey of bar hopping until 6 AM. This is not how you pace yourself for Tales of the Cocktail.Day Two No surprise that it's difficult to peel myself out of bed at 9 AM for the first seminar of the week. I feel like trash, and no amount of electrolytes can save me now. I grab a coffee, fold some scrambled eggs in a piece of bread, and eat breakfast while power walking to the seminar.  I arrive fully dripping in sweat to 'Hey Scotch, Where's My Age Statement?' Normally I wouldn't love the idea of drinking Scotch at 10 in the morning, but I welcome the hair of the dog with open arms. I learn that that older does not always equal better in the world of whisky, and that alcohol professionals are maniacs. 'If I'm not feeling 100 percent in the morning after having a few wee drams of Scotch the night before, I always get up and go to the gym,' a Scotch ambassador tells me. 'My mindset: there is no wallowing allowed.' Tales is full of opportunities to drink. Photo courtesy Jennifer Mitchell Photography.  The idea of working out right now sounds truly insane. I continue my wallowing and head to an agave spirits tasting room to pick at the scant remains of a cheese plate like a vulture. At the next seminar, Charlotte Voisey, the director of brand advocacy for William Grant & Sons, leads a presentation on all things cherry-related (There are 120 different varieties of cherries, who knew?).  Voisey has attended Tales eleven times. She swears by coconut water, kombucha, nutrient-dense food, and working out to combat the booze backlash. 'Morning exercise is also a big part of my routine,' she says. 'If there is anything to sweat out, it's best to do sooner rather than later.'  I sulk back to my room for a deep, deep nap, waking up hours later in the dark. After dinner, it's time for the William Grant & Sons 'Love Supreme' portfolio party. These parties provide opportunities for alcohol companies to put their brands in front of influential bar people. Tonight Sailor Jerry rum is doling out free tattoos. Hendrick's Gin has this giant steampunk-y garnish-making contraption powered by a guy bicycling on top of it. The 'Love Supreme' party. Photo courtesy Jennifer Mitchell Photography. Men and women in the prime of their lives float around the huge Mississippi Riverside venue. It's not the shitshow I expected. I only spot a few zombie drunk imbibers, but people are handling themselves pretty gracefully considering the situation.  'I think [Tales is] changing. It sounds crazy but I think this year people are behaving a little bit more,' Martini global ambassador Roberta Mariani tells me. It's her third year at Tales, an event she handles in moderation. 'I think the best advice would be take care of yourself. You don't need to get wasted during Tales of the Cocktail.'  After the party there's an after party, followed by more drinking after that. At Erin Rose, an Irish pub known for its frozen Irish coffees, I corner Shawn Cantley, the co-owner of Louisville whiskey haunts like The Silver Dollar, to get his Tales tips.  'I try to drink a lot of water, try not to do shots—although I just fucking had a shot—and try to drink sessionable beers,' Cantley says. 'I day drink all day with these fucking guys. I just drink Modelo and water.' His day-after drinking meal is menudo. 'I think the best hangover cure in the world is menudo, but you're not going to find menudo in New Orleans,' Cantley says. 'I think the closest you're going to get is pho.' I end the night with a Miller High Life and go to sleep with the sunrise. I am my own worst enemy.WATCH: The Hangover Show: Avocado Toast Pizza Day 3  By the grace of God, I get to sleep in on the third day of Tales. I drink some Pedialyte cut with water and heave my weary bones toward the hotel gym wearing some alcohol brand swag I've repurposed for my athleisure needs. If bartenders and brand ambassadors can power through the pain, so can I—or at least that's what I'm telling myself.  The workout does not go well.  It feels like someone is smashing an ice pick into my temples as I try to squat my way out of misery. I start lifting some weights and wait for my headache to stop its shrill terror, but it doesn't. I found some solace on the elliptical and slog through twenty minutes of floppy cardio. I feel a little better post-sweat. I feel a little worse after I hit up different brand activations and eat some heavy Southern food.  At night, it's time for Bacardi's massive Neon Tide portfolio party. It's lavish as hell. I ask people how much they think the party cost to throw, and get estimates between $600,000 and two million dollars. There are stilt performers lumbering around the packed warehouse decorated like a jungle. We drink rum slushie cocktails and cups full of Cazadores until the party is over.  We find things to drink elsewhere until 5 AM. I appear to be an old dog incapable of learning tricks.  READ MORE: Oaxaca Has a Minty Cure For Your Hangover Day Four  More Pedialyte, more coffee, and more day drinking on day four. I have to be at a Scotch seminar at 10 am that turns out to be more of a roast. The audience samples different Scotches while brand ambassadors call each other out for their bad teeth, low YouTube tutorial views, and whisky making practices.  I follow up the scotch with some mezcal at El Silencio's party down the street. In a lightly BDSM-themed room upstairs, they're serving mezcal negronis, free condoms, and complimentary tattoos.  Inside the Suite Silencio party. Photo by the author.On a leather couch, I catch up with Natalia Garcia Bourke, El Silencio's brand director and five-time Tales survivor. She tells me she learned from her mentors how to make it through the festival alive. 'They were really adamant about all of their different instructions on how to have the best time of your life without fucking yourself up,' Bourke says.  For treating hangovers, Bourke reaches for more of the same. 'My mom always said have the hair of the dog that bit you. So you have a  little bit of something you were having the night before, for me it's mezcal obviously,' she says. 'A michelada is a life-send in the afternoon.' Suite Silencio's spooky sage-burning guy. Photo by Joshua Brasted. A few mezcal pours later, Birds & Bees bartender Cole Rapkin shares his hangover routine with me. 'A cup of coffee, a cup of water, and a cup of orange juice works every time. Smoking a bowl also helps,' he says. 'Not to get raunchy, but a little rough sex always helps.'  He's not the only one at the party who vouches for carnal cures. 'There are two things that have always worked for me. The first is having sex with whoever I happen to go home with the night before again,' says Manulele Distller's Kyle Reutner. 'The second one is a haircut, a haircut really works. Getting your haircut works. You go in, they give you a little head massage, cut your hair and your hangover is gone. All of the other stuff is bullshit.'  I go back to the hotel and take another stab at a hangover workout. A whiskey ambassador I met the night before is doing the same. We exchange sweaty pleasantries and I start cranking out sit-ups. Lo and behold, I feel better with each heaving crunch.  At dusk, I stop by Fernet's party in an old opera house where they're mercifully serving muffalettas to help soak up all that needs to be soaked up. I ask Nicola Olianas, the global ambassador for Fratelli Branca, about how he approaches drinking at Tales. 'My thing is, first of all, I try to drink good things. Quality,' he says. The morning after a big booze night, the Italian starts the day with his own supply.  'What I'm doing, no matter where I am in the world, the first thing I do in the morning, I'm having just a little sip of Fernet-Branca,' he says. 'The bitterness, the herbs, stimulate your body to fight back everything so you can keep on going and start the day.'  Olianas champions drinking Fernet for its low sugar content but gravitates toward sugar when it comes to his favorite hangover meals.  'As an Italian, for me in the morning a cappuccino and croissant is what we get. In Sicily, for example, if it's the summer, a croissant with ice cream, gelato, inside which is fantastic. I would suggest to everybody go there and try it,' he says. 'Here in New Orleans, what I'm having is some nice cinnamon rolls. Some nice cakes.' Tonight's big portfolio is another next level production thrown by Diageo, a company that boasted more than 15 billion dollars in revenues last year. Snoop partnered with Diageo's Tanqueray gin in 2016, so he's here tonight performing at The Dogg House. Outside the venue, I cross paths with LA restaurateur Med Abrous, whose Hollywood bar The Spare Room is up for multiple Tales Spirited Awards®. He tells me he hasn't found any solid hangover cures yet, but feels a little better if he drinks a coconut water before bed. He has, however, picked up helpful hydration tips from the wine industry. 'Any somm or winemaker will tell you, because they drink wine all day, that if you take as much water as you do wine, you can drink as much as you fucking want,' Abrous says. 'If you balance out the ounces of water to wine, you're pretty much all good. Do I do that regularly? Absolutely not.'  READ MORE: The Easiest Hangover Cure from One of the World's Best ChefsAfter Snoop's performance, it's time to get out of The Dogg House and keep drinking somewhere else. It's Friday night and absolute pandemonium back on Bourbon Street. New Orleans' most notorious strip of bars and restaurants is flooded with groups of revelers. I can't count all of the bachelor and bachelorette parties. I am completely burned out from the marathon imbibing of the past few days and cannot feign enthusiasm when some dude throws Mardi Gras beads my way. I escape the madness at Absinthe House and still manage to stay up later than any human should. I choose not to look at the clock when I finally go to bed.   Day Five  A quick shower and I'm off to the airport at 8 AM. There are some other slumped-over bodies at my gate. I find a chair and slump over, too. Yes I survived, but it will take a while to recover from the hedonism. I need more Pedialyte, or maybe just sobriety. This first appeared on MUNCHIES in August 2017.;drinking

5a0390c629d2680bfcf09b3e;en_us;2018-01-23;"The Guy Who Played Barney the Dinosaur Now Runs a Tantric Sex Business He started his current practice in 2004, and finds clients any number of ways, from word of mouth to converting women he’s met on Tinder into believers. A full session with tantra massage specialist and spiritual healer David Joyner lasts three to four hours and costs $350. For that price, female clients—the only kind he accepts—can expect to receive a ritual bath, chakra balancing, and a massage. Also on the menu: cosmic, mind-blowing orgasms. The latter can be achieved through massage alone. But the goal of a session is to fully release a woman’s blocked energy.  “When the lingam [penis] and the yoni [vagina] meet, there’s a certain energy that takes place that hands on the body alone cannot create,” says Joyner, 54, whose yogi-like presence is often accompanied by a warm smile when we meet for the first of several interviews. “Even through G-spot massage, it’s still not the same energy that flows.” Today Joyner’s tantric massage practice boasts 30 clients—or “goddesses,” as he calls them—and he unblocks the energy of two to four women a week, he says. It’s a tad different than his work as a software analyst at Texas Instruments, a job he held for six years and landed shortly after graduating from ITT Technical Institute. But, Joyner says, his current work in tantra does share many similarities to another job he held from 1991 to 2001, that of Barney, the beloved purple dinosaur on the hit PBS children's show Barney & Friends.   “The energy I brought up [while] in the costume is based on the foundation of tantra, which is love,” he explains. “Everything stems, grows, and evolves from love. Even when you have emotionally blocked energy, the best way to remove it is to remove it with love, and then replace it with God’s divine love. Love heals and allows you to continue to grow.”  Barney, of course, radiated pure, joyful love. It was part of what children, still full of innocence, found so appealing about him. And it’s what many parents, beaten down to various degrees by the sobering realities of the world, found so goddamn cloying. Joyner gave expression to that love through his physical portrayal of the exuberant T-Rex. (During his stint, it was mostly actor Bob West who gave voice to the character.)  “Before I got into the [Barney] costume, I would pray and ask God to allow his loving divine spirit to flow through me through the costume and let that draw the kids. That energy would always draw them in,” Joyner says. “Children are more connected spiritually than [adults]. A lot of times when I see infants and I’m out and about at the grocery store or whatever, they start staring at me. I make the joke, ‘You know who I am.’” Joyner says he also used his tantra training to maintain his energy during long days on the set where he wore the hot (temps could reach 120 degrees inside it), 70-pound costume for several hours and numerous takes for various scenes. Tantra helped him 'maintain an abundance of joy during the process,” he says.  For many in the West, the word 'tantra' conjures up images of Sting engaging in seven-hour marathon sex, but the practice has roots in both Buddhism and Hinduism going back thousands of years, and contains many facets.  “Tantra is a spiritual science of consciousness. Its goal is to liberate us from the unconscious programming that keeps us from recognizing the divinity in ourselves and all beings,” says Matthias Rose, a certified tantra educator with the Source School of Tantra and founder of the Moksha Tantra Center in Seattle. Classical tantra included sexuality as one practice among many designed to help us expand our consciousness beyond the ordinary reality of the “ego” self, says Rose. He adds, “If there is corruption, it came about in the marketing of books, videos, and ultimately escort services that all began to use the word tantra as a shorthand for 'mindful sexuality.' Sex sells, so... there you have it.' “When you go down on a woman (orally), it should be just like you’re saying grace, like blessing the food you’re about to receive.' — David Joyner How Joyner speaks about tantra today won't help clear up any confusion. He's the type of guy prone to spitting out a quote like this: “When you go down on a woman (orally), it should be just like you’re saying grace, like blessing the food you’re about to receive. No food in the world can compare to goddess nectar because spirit is involved. Before you taste the goddess nectar, give thanks. Say grace. I would love women to understand how powerful that energy is.” And the mission statement on his website tantraharmony.com reads: “Connecting your mind, body and spirit together as one, in perfect harmony. Achieving a higher and more blissful state of awareness to your sexuality, and who you are as a spiritual being.”  For clients, this 'higher and more blissful state of awareness' is often best achieved through penetrative, ideally unprotected sex, according to Joyner. Condoms 'block the energy,” he says, and he prefers not to use them. Joyner provides his STD test results to prospective clients, who are asked to disclose any STDs in a signed consent form prior to their first session. These methods, according to other tantra coaches, are highly unorthodox.  Kaya Kwan Yin is a tantra life coach with more than 100 hours training and a full-time tantra business that sees her working primarily with male clients. She says the idea that condoms could “block energy” sounds “shady” and “ridiculous.' “Tantric sex can happen with your clothes on. What typically looks like penis and vagina penetration is often referred to as 'full union' in contemporary practice. Sexual energy penetrates clothes, condoms, countries, and beyond. Having sex with clients in the world of tantra is more of an anomaly than the norm,” Yin said via Skype from her home in Tokyo. But Joyner very much believes in his practice. “Once the lingam is inside the yoni, there’s a technique where you don’t even move. You’re harmonizing spiritually and consciously, as you’re looking into each other’s eyes, and you’re feeling each other’s energy take place. This is about energy moving up.” This goes beyond the realm of the merely physical, says Joyner, and into the spiritual. “A lot of women have never really had spiritual sex.”  “I strongly disagree with this,' says Rose. 'I can’t say there’s never a place for intercourse; it’s part of the tantric tool set, but in a client/practitioner relationship, it’s almost always never needed—particularly for healing purposes.' Rose goes on to say that, energetically, everything you can do for a client can be done with the hands. For aligning chakras, you don’t even need touch. Touch is necessary for releasing trauma the body holds, but that touch is best done with hands, because 'our heart energy is in our hands,' Rose says. 'Beyond that, there’s so much risk to adding trauma when intercourse is involved.'  Kimberly Resnick Anderson, a sex therapist and professor of psychiatry at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine, says she’s all for people luxuriating in their sexual experiences, but shares Rose's concerns about Joyner’s practice of having intercourse with clients—especially unprotected.  'Even porn stars in California use a condom,' she says. 'It’s the law. For him not to use condoms is medically unethical and irresponsible. This is outrageous and far outside the standard of care.” Joyner began his current practice in 2004, and finds clients any number of ways, from word of mouth to converting women he’s met on Tinder into believers. He sees clients in their homes all over LA, from Brentwood to Long Beach to deep in the Valley—and even out of state. His website contains several “Goddess Testimonials,” each more breathless than the last in its effusive praise of Joyner and the benefits of sessions with him. Joyner says that before or during his initial consultation with a client, if he feels they’re not ready for, or can’t handle the spiritual experience—or are simply looking for a physical release—he will not take them on.     One client, Lisa, 50, who like Joyner’s other clients preferred to use a pseudonym to maintain privacy, said by phone that she found Joyner through Tinder. She had intercourse with him around the third session and described it as a “spiritual awakening.” She's now been a client for three years. She says it took her a few sessions before she was comfortable enough with Joyner to have intercourse. “It wasn’t as if I felt like I had to have a full session to get there, but then again it was like, maybe I do,” she says. Lisa has also occasionally insisted that Joyner wear a condom when they have sex. Another client, Indigo, 53, works as a nurse. She spends her life caring for others, she told VICE by phone, and considers her sessions with Joyner time to focus on herself. “I didn’t go all the way the first time, because he could feel my hesitation,' she says. 'But after the first few sessions, I started to really let go.' David Joyner during his time as Barney. (Photo by Barbara Laing/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images) None of the three clients VICE spoke to, provided through Joyner, say they felt pressured or coerced into sex with Joyner, who also vehemently denies anything of the sort. Joyner has no claims filed against him for sexual harassment or coercion for sex in Los Angeles, according to a statement provided to VICE by the Los Angeles Police Department. Still, the power dynamic at play here between practitioner and client, healer and student, is hard to square for some. Laura Palumbo is the communications director with the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. She says a tantra session like Joyner’s that includes intercourse can muddy the waters of consent. “I think when we are looking at a scenario like this the goal is to not be sex negative,' Palumbo tells VICE by phone. 'But, taking a deeper look, it does seem like there are dynamics here that make it a little more complicated and less straightforward than two consenting adults.'  “There’s always a consideration that an individual could be using their notoriety to in some way pressure or coerce someone into a sexual behavior that maybe is not something they are comfortable with,' Palumbo adds. 'And the fact that there’s a spiritual component makes this even more complex, because the terms of engagement may have really been influenced by the participant’s desire to be compliant with spiritual standards—especially if they’re looking to that individual for guidance or leadership. It’s not a level playing field.”  It might also be illegal. In the state of California, massage with the intent of causing arousal is considered solicitation. To protect himself, Joyner says he had a police officer friend help him write a contract that he has all potential clients sign during the consultation process stating they’re not law enforcement or part of a sting operation. He says that the first session is free, and, without money exchanged, the session is legal consent. This, he contends, is his legal loophole.          David Joyner today. Photo via David Joyner  Not so, according to California defense attorney Jonathan Kelman. The fact that Joyner charges for subsequent sessions, Kelman says, means if a client of Joyner's happened to complain to authorities, Joyner could be charged with the act of prostitution, if said session did indeed include intercourse or massage with the intent of causing arousal. “You can’t legally have sex with someone in exchange for money,' Kelman says. 'If I have a client who gets arrested for exchanging a Big Mac for sex, that’s, by definition, prostitution.' “If I had sex with a patient, it would be criminal, and I would be prosecuted and lose my license,' says Anderson for sake of comparison. “Not all of my sessions have sex or ‘spiritual intimacy.’ It’s only in the full-sessions, when someone is ready to take the sexual energy to a higher level,' says Joyner. 'Because then it’s about understanding that when the lingam and the yoni connect there’s a spiritual exchange that takes place, not physical pleasure. It’s not about sex or trying to coerce someone into have sex. It’s about removing emotionally blocked energy.' Joyner discovered tantra and spiritual sexuality in the 1980s at age 20 while training in Swedish massage, which he took up as a way to make extra money while at ITT. He began connecting the two when, while practicing massage on the side of his main gig at TI, clients began telling him his touch aroused them, he says.  He continued deeper into his studies, and shared his love of tantra openly until he was asked to put a lid on it upon being cast as Barney in '91. According to Joyner, attorneys for the show told him he was not allowed to teach, practice, or talk about tantra while under contract playing the character—he was told it was a lawsuit waiting to happen. Still, he practiced covertly throughout his decade in the purple suit and says his devotion to tantra remained a secret he'd share with some members of the crew. But all who worked on the show, he maintains, could sense a certain energy about him. “They knew I was spiritual, and that I meditated.”    “I often shared with the crew that the energy I brought up in the costume is based on the foundation of tantra—love,” he says.  Stephen White was the head writer of the Barney franchise from 1992 to 2005, and says he just found out about Joyner’s life in tantra a few years ago. He can see how the pieces fit. 'I did know David was a very spiritual guy, very positive guy—he radiated energy,” he says. “He was a positive person to be around.” 'When I found out the detail of what’s involved in tantra, I was surprised,” White continues. “I thought it was an interesting transition for Barney. It’s kind of still the ‘I love you, you love me’ deal, but different. I don’t judge or anything, but that’s a side of David I didn’t know.” 'David was eccentric and wonderful and into things that I wouldn’t have been privy to given my age at the time,' says Leah Montes, now 39, who played “Luci” from age 9 to 15 on Barney & Friends (credited in all her appearances under her maiden name) for much of the time Joyner was in the costume. “He was a normal, funny, really energetic, and happy guy.” Joyner says he wants to spread the word of tantra and the power of the goddess energy. He does it now as a tantra massage specialist. For a decade, he did it across TV screens all over the nation as Barney the purple dinosaur. He sees many similarities between the two. “I always said it was never an accident, and that I was meant to do this character,” he says. 'Because a lot of the elements of Barney were a lot of the things I was training with in tantra.' Follow Rebekah Sager on Twitter. ";children
596dcb88d1c9b519aee35b66;en_us;2018-02-18;" I Ate Hunter S. Thompson's Infamous Breakfast And I'll Never Do It Again It sucks to be naked in the rain—especially if your body is full of tequila, bacon, and coke. This article originally appeared on MUNCHIES Denmark. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Hunter S. Thompson knew that. Had he not shot himself in the head and collapsed in front of his typewriter on February 20, 2005, the idolized hedonist and gonzo journalist would have turned 80 earlier this week on July 18.  While Thompson had a disjointed, chaotic lifestyle and was chronically screwed up 24/7, he used breakfast as an anchor point—a kind of connection to reality. In a  Rolling Stone article from June 3, 1976, when he was actually in the process of weighing and measuring President Jimmy Carter, Thompson got a sudden hunch and took a walk on the wild side—as was his habit. His quirky brain was in an entirely different place, and in the next paragraph, he explained the reverence he felt towards the day's first meal, and what it ideally should consist of. Here's the quote:  'I like to eat breakfast alone, and almost never before noon; anybody with a terminally jangled lifestyle needs at least one psychic anchor every twenty four hours, and mine is breakfast. In Hong Kong, Dallas, or at home—and regardless of whether or not I have been to bed—breakfast is a personal ritual that can only be properly observed alone, and in a spirit of genuine excess. The food factor should always be massive: Four bloody Marys, two grapefruits, a pot of coffee, Rangoon crêpes, a half-pound of either sausage, bacon, or corned beef-hash with diced chilies, a Spanish omelette or eggs Benedict, a quart of milk, a chopped lemon for random seasoning, and something like a slice of Key lime pie, two margaritas, and six lines of the best cocaine for dessert... Right, and there should also be two or three newspapers, all mail and messages, a telephone, a notebook for planning the next twenty four hours, and at least one source of good music... All of which should be dealt with outside, in the warmth of the hot sun, and preferably stone naked.' As an homage to history's most insane journalist, I decided to recreate his breakfast. Or maybe 'create' is a more correct term, because I don't think Thompson ingested a round this staggering every morning. He was always known to exaggerate, and the preparation time alone should prevent him from starting his days like that. A round like this every morning would probably have caused him to die from the first meal of the day, long before he shot himself. READ MORE: Hunter S. Thompson Tried to Get Paid in Cocaine at My Tequila BarI quickly reached the conclusion that it would be downright harmful to try to ingest such excessive quantities, especially so early in the day, so I decided to share the extravagant breakfast with my friend 'Ziggy Silver', who wants to be anonymous for the purposes of this article. He is a poet and aspiring alcoholic, and has in the past assisted me during my culinary and literary escapades. And Ziggy also owns an allotment garden where we can behave like idiots without too many prying eyes. I'd slept four hours, had a thumping hangover, and it was pissing rain on the allotments in Søborg. Essentially, it was summer in Denmark. When I opened the rusty gate to Ziggy's home, I got an ominous feeling in my body. Breakfast should be a good start of the day, and I wasn't sure Thompson's recipe would give us that.  Ziggy was more upbeat and went immediately to work making Bloody Marys and juicing us up with modern rhythms. There were large portions of his life when Thompson stayed at hotels all over the United States. If you can order room service and get your employer to pay, it may well be possible to concoct as extensive a meal as described. But if you have to make the food yourself, you will for sure die of hunger before you reach the finish line. Although I had prepared some things from home, (I had 'cheated a little,' as TV chefs say), I did work in the kitchen for two solid hours. Drops of sweat ran down my forehead faster than the raindrops on the window, and my head felt very heavy. In a way, it was perfectly authentic that I had a hangover. With the amount of alcohol that Thompson drank, it must have been a chronic state for him—a life condition pure and simple.READ MORE: I Made Marijuana Edibles at Hunter S. Thompson's Ranch'I'm fucking hungry, G.,' said Ziggy, lighting up at the table. I told him to shut up. I get irritated when I'm hungry.He told me a story about a biker who'd given him a guitar the day before, while I poached eggs, fried bacon, made pancakes, and boiled water for coffee. It all began to take shape. Outside the rain still raged, but Thompson said that the food should be consumed under the open sky. In the nude. When we took off our pants and set the food on the table, I cursed the motherfucker. I don't think he has ever eaten breakfast in this shithole of a country where it rains approximately every other day. After noting that a wet lawn chair is cold to sit on when your ass is bare, we attacked the food with the same appetite that punk musicians go at the amphetamine buffet after a concert. 'This stuff is good,' said Ziggy, through a mouthful of eggs benedict. 'Together with the Bloody Mary, this really is the perfect start of the day for a lad from the countryside.'The author (on the right), with Ziggy.Crêpes Rangoon with its creamy crab filling was almost as delicious, and we smiled happily at each other while the drizzling rain descended on our naked bodies. I alternated between a Bloody Mary, a glass of milk, and a cup of coffee while I checked my email on my phone, because in our digital reality, 'Two or three newspapers, mail, messages, a telephone, notebook, and a source of good music' is contained all on one small device. 'Shouldn't we have dessert soon?' asked Ziggy, nodding towards an empty plate. In no time at all, six lines of coke were lined up inside on the kitchen table. Shortly after, I wasn't cold anymore and my hands were tingling.'I think it's time for guns now,' I said, swaying a little as I stood up with my margarita in hand. Ziggy positioned a carton of juice, stared at me with wide eyes, and shot holes in the target with an air gun. Razor-sharp. My heart pounded completely out of control when it was my turn to shoot, and I don't think I have ever felt closer to understanding what it was like to live like Hunter S. Thompson. Back at the table, I noticed that we had forgotten to eat the pie, but it was too much for both of us. Although we had shared Thompson's breakfast, we could not squeeze another bit down, and I felt super weird. Too full, somewhat drunk, coked out, wet, naked, and with an increasing hangover, I took a large sip of my margarita to calm down. It did not help. A few moments later, I puked in a scrub. The kitchen was a mess, there were half-eaten dishes all over the place, and I crashed on the couch. I needed to write an article, but I could barely stand up. Ziggy wasn't finished with the dessert. While nausea overwhelmed me, I thought of another quote from Thompson: 'If a thing like this is worth doing, it's worth doing right.' This apparently also applies to breakfast. Happy birthday, old boy. This first appeared on MUNCHIES in July 2017.";alcohol

No, you don't look like you've been working out. But if you've made it here, you're bound to have some mighty fine pectoral muscles in the form of crispy, perfectly seasoned chicken breast meat. See, despite being called 'fingers,' those breaded strips of chicken that we've come to know and love as a staple of sports-bar snacking certainly don't come from the phalanges of birds. Unlike nuggets, which can be loaded with fat, connective tissue, and all other kinds of leftover chicken meat scraps, chicken fingers are all breast; chew on that.

5a4bbb59ca17162852ddc86b;en_us;2018-01-02;Did Racism Kill Erica Garner? The 27-year-old activist whose father's killing sparked a national outcry did not die at the hands of police like him. But her death is still an outrage that speaks to systemic American hate. After 43-year-old Eric Garner was killed by an illegal NYPD chokehold on Staten Island in 2014, his daughter Erica cried out for police reform in America. Her dad's alleged offense—selling loose, untaxed cigarettes—fit into a pattern of law enforcement preying on communities of color for minor offenses, and Erica, like thousands of others, demanded accountability from police who seemed to occupy as much as they protected and served.  When Erica Garner died at just 27 this weekend after a heart attack and subsequent coma, a long-standing conversation about self-care in activist circles resurfaced. But those who know racism kills in this country can't be blamed for seeing another culprit here.     A few weeks after Eric Garner's killing, Michael Brown, 18 and unarmed, was shot dead by Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, spurring nationwide protests among those weary of an unrelenting police brutality. The wait-and-let’s-see-what-the-justice-system-does approach that prevailed in 17-year-old Trayvon Martin’s 2012 shooting death, where wannabe cop George Zimmerman got off scot-free, was over. The extrajudicial killing of Eric Garner was a crucial catalyst for the genesis of the Black Lives Matter movement, as people across the country chanted his final words, “I can’t breathe.” Erica Garner's death was obviously more complicated—according to the  New York Times, she had a heart attack stemming from asthma, a condition her father also struggled with. (I reached out to the Garner family for comment for this story but did not hear back prior to publication.) But experts and activists well-versed in the myriad ways race affects mortality in America were quick to cite the systemic shortening of black life in this country. “When has racism not killed?” kihana miraya ross, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Texas at Austin Institute for Urban Policy Research & Analysis, wondered in an interview. “Whether that's in the form of outright murder as in the case of Erica Garner's father, or health related or even black-on-black crime that stems from racialized capitalism, racialized housing disparities, and the numerous traumas both individual and collective that come from existing as the antithesis to everything pure, clean, and white—being raced as black has always killed us.”Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who placed Garner in the fatal chokehold, was never charged in his homicide, and in fact remains on modified duty with the NYPD. But racism has a devastating impact on longevity for black people—especially black women—in America, even when cops aren't involved. Bridget Goosby, PhD., a sociologist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln, specifically cited heart problems among low-income black women, and higher rates of obesity and diabetes for those women as a whole. And for middle-class black women, being tokenized in mostly white work spaces can create social isolation, where hitting a special kind of “glass ceiling” is linked to discrimination that opens the door to chronic disease and shorter life spans. Lest anyone think this stuff is all in the heads of activists or social justice warriors, racism's harm to black lives has been well-documented at the highest levels. The Institute of Medicine affirmed as much with its 2002 report, “Unequal Treatment,” where a blue-ribbon panel of medical experts confirmed that while black and brown patients have unequal health outcomes, they also get unequal healthcare compared to whites, even when other factors, like insurance status, are equal. Racist experiences are also linked to adult-onset asthma in black women, one Boston University study found in 2013. The more racism experienced by 38,000-plus black women studied from 1997 to 2011, the more incidences of adult-onset asthma, according to Black Women’s Health Study results published in the journal Chest.  “Racism is a significant stressor in the lives of African American women, and our results contribute to a growing body of evidence indicating that experiences of racism can have adverse effects on health,” Patricia Coogan, the professor and epidemiologist who led the study, said at the time. Pamela Merritt, co-director of Reproaction, a reproductive justice organization, told me activists like Garner are particularly susceptible to toxic stress. “When you’re navigating the world as a black activist, you work daily confrontation with white supremacy. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of oxygen for what liberals would call self-care. I prefer to call it ‘personal ecology.’'  Merritt found she needed to make some changes after attending a leadership training session in 2016. The overall feedback she got from white peers was they could tell she was stressed and riddled with anxiety.  “I shouldn’t have had to fake it,” Merritt, 44, said. “That is a factor we need to talk about because it is going to kill us. How many times have I been in a room with activists who haven’t been to the doctor in a year, gotten their blood pressure checked, or wished they could exercise more? There’s this freakish rhythmic cycle of resistance.” Last week, Merritt got a mammogram and posted on social media that it was easy. “I wish I had tagged five people and said, ‘Do you want me to go with you? We need to do with health what we do with movement work, when we commit to march and take ten people with us.” Goosby, well-versed in transgenerational effects of racism, pointed to birth disparities between black and white women, a phenomenon that hasn’t changed since Jim Crow, she said. The odds of low birth weight is 1.6 times larger for black babies than white babies, and preterm birth is 1.9 times larger even when factoring in social economic status. A recent ProPublica series eloquently highlighted the impact of racism in pregnancy and childbirth for black women, who are as much as three times more likely to die from complications that arise in childbirth as whites, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  “For much of American history, these types of disparities were largely blamed on blacks’ supposed innate susceptibility to illness—their “mass of imperfections,” as one doctor wrote in 1903—and their own behavior. But now many social scientists and medical researchers agree, the problem isn’t race but racism,” ProPublica reported. Under the weight of all the evidence of how taxing prejudice is on the average black woman, we can start to make sense of why Erica Garner’s big, generous heart gave out. One way or another, racism, the toxic sludge of American hate, broke it.  Follow Deborah Douglas on Twitter. ;cops
5a4bbb59ca17162852ddc86b;en_us;2018-01-02;Did Racism Kill Erica Garner? The 27-year-old activist whose father's killing sparked a national outcry did not die at the hands of police like him. But her death is still an outrage that speaks to systemic American hate. After 43-year-old Eric Garner was killed by an illegal NYPD chokehold on Staten Island in 2014, his daughter Erica cried out for police reform in America. Her dad's alleged offense—selling loose, untaxed cigarettes—fit into a pattern of law enforcement preying on communities of color for minor offenses, and Erica, like thousands of others, demanded accountability from police who seemed to occupy as much as they protected and served.  When Erica Garner died at just 27 this weekend after a heart attack and subsequent coma, a long-standing conversation about self-care in activist circles resurfaced. But those who know racism kills in this country can't be blamed for seeing another culprit here.     A few weeks after Eric Garner's killing, Michael Brown, 18 and unarmed, was shot dead by Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, spurring nationwide protests among those weary of an unrelenting police brutality. The wait-and-let’s-see-what-the-justice-system-does approach that prevailed in 17-year-old Trayvon Martin’s 2012 shooting death, where wannabe cop George Zimmerman got off scot-free, was over. The extrajudicial killing of Eric Garner was a crucial catalyst for the genesis of the Black Lives Matter movement, as people across the country chanted his final words, “I can’t breathe.” Erica Garner's death was obviously more complicated—according to the  New York Times, she had a heart attack stemming from asthma, a condition her father also struggled with. (I reached out to the Garner family for comment for this story but did not hear back prior to publication.) But experts and activists well-versed in the myriad ways race affects mortality in America were quick to cite the systemic shortening of black life in this country. “When has racism not killed?” kihana miraya ross, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Texas at Austin Institute for Urban Policy Research & Analysis, wondered in an interview. “Whether that's in the form of outright murder as in the case of Erica Garner's father, or health related or even black-on-black crime that stems from racialized capitalism, racialized housing disparities, and the numerous traumas both individual and collective that come from existing as the antithesis to everything pure, clean, and white—being raced as black has always killed us.”Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who placed Garner in the fatal chokehold, was never charged in his homicide, and in fact remains on modified duty with the NYPD. But racism has a devastating impact on longevity for black people—especially black women—in America, even when cops aren't involved. Bridget Goosby, PhD., a sociologist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln, specifically cited heart problems among low-income black women, and higher rates of obesity and diabetes for those women as a whole. And for middle-class black women, being tokenized in mostly white work spaces can create social isolation, where hitting a special kind of “glass ceiling” is linked to discrimination that opens the door to chronic disease and shorter life spans. Lest anyone think this stuff is all in the heads of activists or social justice warriors, racism's harm to black lives has been well-documented at the highest levels. The Institute of Medicine affirmed as much with its 2002 report, “Unequal Treatment,” where a blue-ribbon panel of medical experts confirmed that while black and brown patients have unequal health outcomes, they also get unequal healthcare compared to whites, even when other factors, like insurance status, are equal. Racist experiences are also linked to adult-onset asthma in black women, one Boston University study found in 2013. The more racism experienced by 38,000-plus black women studied from 1997 to 2011, the more incidences of adult-onset asthma, according to Black Women’s Health Study results published in the journal Chest.  “Racism is a significant stressor in the lives of African American women, and our results contribute to a growing body of evidence indicating that experiences of racism can have adverse effects on health,” Patricia Coogan, the professor and epidemiologist who led the study, said at the time.

She was so traumatized that she never spoke again.  A rape survivor from Ufa, southwest Russia has died of her injuries two years after a brutal and sustained assault that horrified the country.Serial sex attacker Gizar Ziyangareev assaulted cosmetics representative Anna Barmina, 33, in September 2015, just one week after being released from prison for sexual assault. He stabbed Barmina with a knife before raping her with a broken tree branch and taking her cash, laptop, and phone. Barmina suffered extensive damage to her internal organs and suffered a heart attack before going into a coma for a year. Despite regaining consciousness, she was so traumatized by the assault that she never spoke again and never left her hospital bed. She was buried at a family funeral in Ufa on December 28. Shortly before her death, a court shortened Ziyangaree's 23-year jail term—one of the longest ever sentences handed out by a Russian court to a rapist—by one month after he claimed that his elderly mother and children were dependent upon him. Barmina’s mother Natalia described him as an “inhuman monster” and criticized the court for not giving the serial rapist the death penalty. 'He will get out of jail one day and continue to rape,' she said in comments reported by the Mirror.Ziyangareev was a convicted sexual predator. In the week he was released from prison for raping a neighbor and underage girl, he went on to rape four more women, including Barmina. After his arrest, the  Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper reported that Ziyangareev was unrepentant and even told police that his victims should be grateful to him.  “This case is awful, really awful,” says Russian anti-violence activist Alena Popova, “but it shows that sexual violence still doesn’t have preventative measures in place from the police or legislatures.” She highlights the court decision to cut Ziyangareev’s sentence as particularly abhorrent, and calls for specific laws to prevent repeat offenders from coming into contact with women, as well as anti-sexual harassment laws.  “The brutal nature of the repeated attacks by this man are a reminder of how much some men hate women,” says Sarah Green of the End Violence Against Women Coalition. “The apparently weak response from the Russian courts is likely related to Russia’s absolutely endemic levels of violence against women and girls.”  For More Stories Like This, Sign Up for Our Newsletter However, Green is hopeful that the situation may change with the FIFA World Cup in Russia later this year and the increasing scrutiny around Russia's human rights record in the lead-up to the football tournament. “We hope that the World Cup this year will put a media spotlight on this and some pressure on the Russian authorities to take sexual violence more seriously.”;sexual assault

Servings: 1Prep: 24 hours (to infuse the brandy)Total: 10 minutes to make the drink Ingredients for the Earl Grey tea brandy: ¼ cup loose-leaf Earl Grey créme tea (if unavailable, standard Earl Grey will do) 1 750-milliliter bottle of brandy (we use Korbel) 1½ teaspoons maple syrup for the tonic: 2 ounces Earl Grey tea brandy ¼ ounce simple syrup 1 sugar cube ¼ ounce overproof rum (we use Gosling’s 151) 2 orange twists (use a vegetable peeler to take off nice big strips) 5 ounces (scant ⅓ cup) boiling water Directions 1. Infuse the brandy: Place the tea in a quart-sized mason jar and pour the brandy over it. Reserve the brandy bottle for the finished product. Screw on the lid and let steep for 24 hours in a dark, cool place. After steeping, carefully pour the maple syrup into the reserved bottle. Strain the brandy from the tea into the bottle using a fine-mesh strainer and funnel. Discard the tea. Freeze for at least 1 hour before serving. 2. Make the cocktail: Place the brandy and simple syrup in a warmed hot toddy glass. Balance a spoon over the top of the glass, and place the sugar cube on it. Carefully pour the rum over the cube, and then light it on fire. Flames! Carefully wave 1 orange twist over the flame for a few seconds, then squeeze the twist into the flame to express the oils. Fireworks! Carefully tip the flamey cube into the cup so that it ignites the liquid in the glass. Pour in the hot water, extinguishing the flames and stirring everything together. Squeeze the second orange twist over the drink to express the oils, and place the twist in the drink. Serve hot.  Excerpted from the book KACHKA by Bonnie Frumkin Morales.

Servings: 1Prep: 24 hours (to infuse the brandy)Total: 10 minutes to make the drink Ingredients for the Earl Grey tea brandy: ¼ cup loose-leaf Earl Grey créme tea (if unavailable, standard Earl Grey will do) 1 750-milliliter bottle of brandy (we use Korbel) 1½ teaspoons maple syrup for the tonic: 2 ounces Earl Grey tea brandy ¼ ounce simple syrup 1 sugar cube ¼ ounce overproof rum (we use Gosling’s 151) 2 orange twists (use a vegetable peeler to take off nice big strips) 5 ounces (scant ⅓ cup) boiling water Directions 1. Infuse the brandy: Place the tea in a quart-sized mason jar and pour the brandy over it. Reserve the brandy bottle for the finished product. Screw on the lid and let steep for 24 hours in a dark, cool place. After steeping, carefully pour the maple syrup into the reserved bottle. Strain the brandy from the tea into the bottle using a fine-mesh strainer and funnel. Discard the tea. Freeze for at least 1 hour before serving. 2. Make the cocktail: Place the brandy and simple syrup in a warmed hot toddy glass. Balance a spoon over the top of the glass, and place the sugar cube on it. Carefully pour the rum over the cube, and then light it on fire. Flames! Carefully wave 1 orange twist over the flame for a few seconds, then squeeze the twist into the flame to express the oils. Fireworks! Carefully tip the flamey cube into the cup so that it ignites the liquid in the glass. Pour in the hot water, extinguishing the flames and stirring everything together. Squeeze the second orange twist over the drink to express the oils, and place the twist in the drink. Serve hot.  Excerpted from the book KACHKA by Bonnie Frumkin Morales.

Male elders in her family and community set the rules early on: She wasn’t supposed to go outside even though her brothers could, she wasn’t supposed to speak loudly, and she wasn’t supposed to wear perfume or fragrance, even though the men did. “What could I do?” Sheikh used to wonder. “It’s not like I chose to be born a woman.” Her younger sister used to say, “In another life, I’ll be born a boy.” Now, Sheikh is a pioneer in the fight rights for Muslim women and girls in India. She is one of the 15 women in the first class of trained  qazis—judges or arbitrators in Islamic family courts—in India. I meet three of these women on a Monday afternoon in late December at the Mumbai offices of the Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA), a Muslim women’s rights group where they all work, and which trained these women as qazis. The organization runs empowerment training sessions for women and girls, holds support groups for boys and men, and leads arbitration sessions where family disputes are settled. Watch: Broadly Voices: Gloria Steinem & Nadia MuradPeople leave their shoes at the door and step inside for help with their problems. The room is crammed full of people who are here for sharia court: Husbands and wives, in-laws and parents, and uncles and neighbors sit on the floor in a room without furniture and talk about their problems. They talk about domestic violence and bride price, about divorce and about marriage, and the women qazis listen patiently, give both men and women space to speak, and then help find resolution. In India, although all citizens have equal rights under the country’s constitution, personal family matters—issues like divorce, marriage, custody, alimony and inheritance—aren’t governed by a single, secular law. Instead, they’re handled differently by different religious groups. There is a Muslim Personal Law, a Hindu Marriage Act, a Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, and more. So, for the country’s 172 million Muslims, qazis—or Islamic clerics or judges, historically all men—are the arbitrators of all marriages and divorces. They do not replace India’s legal courts, but are widely accepted as an alternative way to mediate family disputes. “A man goes and says ‘I want to divorce my wife,’ then the qazi—also with a man’s perspective—he signs off on the divorce. But these injustices happen with women, so why can’t we also become qazis?' Sheikh says.Suriya Sheikh meets with women in the community at the Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan office in Mumbai, India. Community members come here for sharia court and to consult the women qazis.  But things are changing, slowly. In August 2017, the Supreme Court in India outlawed triple talaq—a practice where Muslim men could divorce their wives simply by saying the word “talaq” (Arabic for “divorce”) to them three times. In the past, men had divorced their wives on text message, while they were sleeping, and in the middle of fights. The lower house of India’s parliament voted to further criminalize the practice in December. For generations, men were the ones to decide when to divorce their wives, and the ones who also decided if these divorces were valid. But these women are trying to change that. Suriya Sheikh, Khatoon Sheikh, and Hena Sidiqqi, along with twelve other women from across India, form the first class of women to become qazis. They trained for three years, studying the constitution and the Quran, learning about Islam, women’s rights, and the law. In April, they graduated and took on their new roles. When I ask them why they became qazis, they all tell me stories about the women they know. The woman whose husband divorced her while she was sleeping. The woman who went to visit her mother and was told by her husband never to come back; the 20-year-old mother of two whose husband divorced her and left her. For Khatoon, it was her sister-in-law. “She was beaten a lot. She had three children. Her husband kicked her out of her house after beating her.” When she saw this happen, she says she knew something had to change. For More Stories Like This, Sign Up for Our Newsletter Sheikh says it wasn’t one story that prompted her to become a qazi. It was how she grew up learning about what it means to be a woman. In her family and community, she saw domestic violence treated not just as a private family matter, but an accepted reality—an almost inevitable fact of life and of marriage. “I saw this in my community growing up, so I started to feel like I don’t want to get married at all. Because all these problems arise after marriage.” This vulnerability that women face within marriage was part of the reason to push for women to have more say in arbitrating family disputes, explains Noorjehan Safia Niaz, a co-founder of the BMMA and one of the women who created the training program for women qazis. While there’s a lot of activism around issues like education and livelihood, she wanted to focus on “what happens to women within the four walls [of her household], the kinds of insecurities she faces from her very close relationships.” “Creating that space for women is very important,” she says, so they “can negotiate and talk… Here, no man decides.”";politics

She was so traumatized that she never spoke again.  A rape survivor from Ufa, southwest Russia has died of her injuries two years after a brutal and sustained assault that horrified the country.Serial sex attacker Gizar Ziyangareev assaulted cosmetics representative Anna Barmina, 33, in September 2015, just one week after being released from prison for sexual assault. He stabbed Barmina with a knife before raping her with a broken tree branch and taking her cash, laptop, and phone. Barmina suffered extensive damage to her internal organs and suffered a heart attack before going into a coma for a year. Despite regaining consciousness, she was so traumatized by the assault that she never spoke again and never left her hospital bed. She was buried at a family funeral in Ufa on December 28. Shortly before her death, a court shortened Ziyangaree's 23-year jail term—one of the longest ever sentences handed out by a Russian court to a rapist—by one month after he claimed that his elderly mother and children were dependent upon him. Barmina’s mother Natalia described him as an “inhuman monster” and criticized the court for not giving the serial rapist the death penalty. 'He will get out of jail one day and continue to rape,' she said in comments reported by the Mirror.Ziyangareev was a convicted sexual predator. In the week he was released from prison for raping a neighbor and underage girl, he went on to rape four more women, including Barmina. After his arrest, the  Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper reported that Ziyangareev was unrepentant and even told police that his victims should be grateful to him.  “This case is awful, really awful,” says Russian anti-violence activist Alena Popova, “but it shows that sexual violence still doesn’t have preventative measures in place from the police or legislatures.” She highlights the court decision to cut Ziyangareev’s sentence as particularly abhorrent, and calls for specific laws to prevent repeat offenders from coming into contact with women, as well as anti-sexual harassment laws.  “The brutal nature of the repeated attacks by this man are a reminder of how much some men hate women,” says Sarah Green of the End Violence Against Women Coalition. “The apparently weak response from the Russian courts is likely related to Russia’s absolutely endemic levels of violence against women and girls.”  For More Stories Like This, Sign Up for Our Newsletter However, Green is hopeful that the situation may change with the FIFA World Cup in Russia later this year and the increasing scrutiny around Russia's human rights record in the lead-up to the football tournament. “We hope that the World Cup this year will put a media spotlight on this and some pressure on the Russian authorities to take sexual violence more seriously.”;uk

YouTube star Logan Paul apologized Tuesday after posting a video showing the body of an apparent suicide victim he discovered while on a recent trip to Japan.  The film, shot in the Aokigahara forest at the base of Mount Fuji, showed Paul’s group stumbling across the body of a man hanged from a tree. It was uploaded to the video-sharing site Sunday and was watched millions of times before it was removed. The 22-year-old YouTuber, who boasts 15 million subscribers and is popular with tweens, apologized for being 'misguided by shock and awe.'  The film shows the group distressed but also laughing at the scene after they came across the corpse in the notorious suicide hotspot.  The face of the victim, who has yet to be identified, is blurred out on several close-ups. After a member of the group says he 'doesn't feel good,' Paul quips: 'What, you never stand next to a dead guy?' before laughing. The 15-minute film sparked a wave of online criticism for the Ohio-born vlogger.       Responding to the criticism, Paul claims he posted the video to raise awareness of suicide and suicide prevention. 'I'm surrounded by good people and believe I make good decisions, but I'm still a human being. I can be wrong,' he wrote. The video was not monetized on YouTube, he said.

5a4d2f7013866d648050ab6a;en_us;2018-01-03;Trump issues official statement: Steve Bannon is crazy The former White House chief strategist has 'lost his mind,' says the president of the United States. President Donald Trump has disavowed his adviser Steve Bannon, saying in an official statement that the two-shirted former White House chief strategist has “lost his mind.” “Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency,” Trump said Wednesday. “When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican Party.”  The president also made a point of diminishing Bannon’s once-influential role in his administration, saying, “Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books.” Trump also blamed Bannon for Roy Moore’s loss in the Alabama special election last month and accused his former adviser of waging war on the media in an effort “to make himself seem far more important than he was. It is the only thing he does well.”  The statements from the president insulting and distancing himself from the man widely credited with helping him win the election came just a few hours after the release of excerpts from a new book about the early days of the Trump administration. In “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” Bannon is quoted by author Michael Wolff as saying that the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between members of the Trump administration and Russians was “treasonous” and that it never should have happened, according to the Guardian. The book appears full of damaging revelations about Trump and his family: Each member of Trump’s entourage, his children included, appear to have understood Trump’s presidency as an opportunity to raise their own profile. Jared and Ivanka agreed that, should one of them have the opportunity to run for president, Ivanka would be the one to go for it, Wolff reports. Bannon apparently found the idea of Ivanka running for president completely laughable.  Other portions confirm widely reported information about Trump and his ambitions: According to the excerpt published by New York Magazine, Trump neither expected to nor wanted to win the 2016 presidential election. “Shortly after 8 p.m. on Election Night, when the unexpected trend — Trump might actually win — seemed confirmed, Don Jr. told a friend that his father, or DJT, as he calls him, looked as if he had seen a ghost,” Wolff’s book claims. “Melania was in tears — and not of joy.”  And chaos reigned in the West Wing during the first several months of Trump’s presidency, Wolff writes, with Jared Kushner, Reince Priebus, and Steve Bannon vying for power under a boss who was often convinced by whomever he had last spoken to. After a meeting with Silicon Valley executives, for example, Trump was apparently briefly convinced that advocating for H-1B visas, which allow skilled workers entry to the U.S., could somehow be squared with his anti-immigrant agenda. “What a fucking idiot,” Rupert Murdoch said, according to Wolff, after Trump explained his H-1B plans over the phone.  Trump also takes reporting on the supposed “pee tape” quite personally, Wolff reports. According to the book, the president believes that he got CNN CEO Jeff Zucker his current job by allowing him to commission “The Apprentice” as an NBC exec.  Zucker was “made by Trump,” Trump supposedly said — making CNN’s reporting on the golden shower dossier all the more of a betrayal. ;russia
